		<h2>Old Fashioned Peach Cobbler</h2>
			<img><img src="peach-cobbler.jpg" width="270" height="180" alt=""/>
			<p>This old-fashioned peach cobbler recipe reminds me of the yummy dessert I ate as a young girl in Southeast Missouri. No shortcuts here. Fresh peaches and homemade crust are worth every minute. Absolutely delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream. Never any leftovers with this dessert!</p>

				<h3>Directions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Gather the ingredients</li>
					<li>Make crust: Sift together flour, 3 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Work in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk together egg and cold water in a small bowl. Sprinkle over flour mixture; work with hands to form dough into a ball. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

</li>
					<li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg; F (175&deg; C). Roll out &frac12; of the chilled dough to &frac18;-inch thickness. Place in a 9&times;13-inch baking dish, covering the bottom and halfway up the sides. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

</li>
					<li>Make filling: Mix peaches, orange juice, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Add butter and cook over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Stir together sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl; mix into peach mixture until combined. Pour into baked crust.</li>
					<li>Roll remaining dough to &frac14;-inch thickness. Cut into &frac12;-inch-wide strips. Weave strips into a lattice over peaches. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar, then drizzle with melted butter.

</li>
					<li>Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
